# Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project demonstrates a basic pipeline for processing and transcribing speech from audio files using Python libraries like `librosa`, `Whisper`, and `transformers`. It is suitable for educational and prototyping purposes related to voice recognition and transcription.

## üìå Features

- Audio upload and preprocessing
  - Silence removal
  - Signal normalization
- Audio visualization (waveform and spectrogram)
- Integration with ASR models (e.g., OpenAI Whisper)
- Optional data analysis and error inspection for accents or noise

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install kaggle
pip install transformers torchaudio librosa noisereduce
pip install openai-whisper
pip install datasets
```

4. Upload your `.wav` audio file when prompted in the notebook.
5. Replace the audio file path in the code:
   ```python
   audio_path = '/your_audio_file.wav'
   ```

## üìä Output

- Cleaned audio waveform
- Spectrogram visualization
- Optional: Transcribed text from audio

## üîç Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- `librosa`
- `matplotlib`
- `transformers`
- `torchaudio`
- `openai-whisper` (optional for transcription)
- `datasets` (optional for evaluation)

## üß† Future Enhancements

- Integrate advanced language models for transcription accuracy.
- Build a UI for easier file uploads and batch processing.
- Evaluate transcription quality using metrics like WER (Word Error Rate).
